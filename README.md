### What is this?
> This is a 2D game created from scratch in Java, inspired by modern rogue-like and role-playing games (such as Binding of Isaac and PokÃ©mon).

### Why?
> This game was originally made as part of a school videogame programming project at Lehman College, in which I was tasked with creating a 2D game from scratch in Java.
> After completing the requirements, I decided to take the project further, adding more intricate features and artwork to make the game feel more polished and complete.
